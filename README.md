## What Is This?

This is a small personal script that runs every morning at 7:30am EST to let me know whether I should put on my winter gloves or not.

## Why?

I'm a weakling when it comes to the cold, mostly due to the fact that I have [Raynaud's disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/raynauds-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20363571) along with a minor case of [frostbite](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frostbite/symptoms-causes/syc-20372656). Stepping outside my door and into the bitter cold is one of the worst feelings for me. ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¤§
